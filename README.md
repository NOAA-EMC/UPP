# Unified Post-Processing (UPP)

The Unified Post Processor (UPP) software package is a software
package designed to generate useful products from raw model
output.

The UPP is currently used in operations with the Global Forecast
System (GFS), GFS Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), North American
Mesoscale (NAM), Rapid Refresh (RAP), High Resolution Rapid Refresh
(HRRR), Short Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF), Hurricane WRF (HWRF)
applications, and is also used in Unified Forecasting System (UFS)
applications.

The UPP provides the capability to compute a variety of diagnostic
fields and interpolate to pressure levels or other vertical
coordinates.

UPP also incorporates the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation
(JCSDA) Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) to compute model
derived brightness temperature (TB) for various instruments and
channels. This additional feature enables the generation of a number
of simulated satellite products including GOES products.

Output from the UPP is in National Weather Service (NWS) and World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) GRIB2 format and can be used
directly by visualization, plotting, or verification packages, or for
further downstream post-processing, e.g. statistical post-processing
techniques.

Examples of UPP products include:

- T, Z, humidity, wind, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and snow on pressure levels
- SLP, shelter level T, humidity, and wind fields
- Precipitation-related fields
- PBL-related fields
- Severe weather products (e.g. CAPE, Vorticity, Wind shear)
- Radiative/Surface fluxes
- Cloud related fields
- Aviation products
- Radar reflectivity products
- Satellite look-alike products

Support for the UFS UPP is provided through the UFS Forum by the
Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for FV3-based applications.

The UPP uses some of the [NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS)
project.

## Prerequisites

This package requires the following NCEPLIBS packages:

- [NCEPLIBS-g2](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-g2)
- [NCEPLIBS-g2tmpl](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-g2tmpl)
- [NCEPLIBS-sp](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-sp)
- [NCEPLIBS-ip](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-ip)
- [NCEPLIBS-bacio](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-bacio)
- [NCEPLIBS-w3emc](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-w3emc)
- [NCEPLIBS-w3nco](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-w3nco)
- [CRTM](https://github.com/noaa-emc/emc_crtm)

Also required to build NCEPpost executable (cmake option
BUILD_POSTEXEC):

- [NCEPLIBS-sigio](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-sigio) -
- [NCEPLIBS-sfcio](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-sfcio) -
- [NCEPLIBS-nemsio](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-nemsio) -
- [NCEPLIBS-gfsio](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-gfsio)

The [NCEPLIBS-wrf_io](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-wrf_io)
library is required to build with NCEPpost with WRF-IO library (cmake
option BUILD_WITH_WRFIO).

The following third-party libraries are required:

- [netcdf-c](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c)
- [netcdf-fortran](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran)
- [Jasper](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper)
- [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
- [libz](https://zlib.net/)

## Building

Builds include:

- Operational use GNC build as Wen described for both library and
  executable (library used for GFS only at this time)

- MRW App uses UPP packaged with nceplibs and cmake to build/run with
  executable (via release/public-v1 branch).

- SRW App uses UPP repo branch/tag directly and uses cmake to
  build/run with executable (via release/public-v2 branch).

- Community standalone uses UPP repo branch/tag directly and uses
  cmake to build/run with executable (via release/public-v2
  branch). For these procedures, we add a
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${INSTALL_PREFIX} where INSTALL_PREFIX is the
  location of the nceplibs installation as a dependency requirement.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install 
make 
make test
make install
```

The adaptation of the original WRF Post Processor package and Users
Guide (by Mike Baldwin of NSSL/CIMMS and Hui-Ya Chuang of NCEP/EMC) was
done by LÃ­gia Bernardet (NOAA/ESRL/DTC) in collaboration with Dusan
Jovic (NCEP/EMC), Robert Rozumalski (COMET), Wesley Ebisuzaki
(NWS/HQTR), and Louisa Nance (NCAR/RAL/DTC). Upgrades to WRF Post
Processor versions 2.2 and higher were performed by Hui-Ya Chuang, Dusan
Jovic and Mathew Pyle (NCEP/EMC). Transitioning of the documentation
from the WRF Post Processor to the Unified Post Processor was performed
by Nicole McKee (NCEP/EMC), Hui-ya Chuang (NCEP/EMC), and Jamie Wolff
(NCAR/RAL/DTC). Implementation of the Community Unified Post Processor
was performed by Tricia Slovacek and Kate Fossell (NCAR/RAL/DTC).

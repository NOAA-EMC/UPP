Code Overview
*************

The UPP can be used to post-process WRF-ARW, WRF-NMM, NMMB, GFS, CFS, and FV3 forecasts with current support within UFS available for FV3 only. It can ingest FV3 history files (dyn*/phy*) in netCDF and binarynemsiompiio format.

Unipost Functionalities:

   -  Interpolates the forecasts from the models native vertical
      coordinate to NWS standard output levels (e.g., pressure, height)
      and computes mean sea level pressure. If the requested parameter
      is on a models native level, then no vertical interpolation is
      performed.

   -  Computes diagnostic output quantities (e.g., convective available
      potential energy, helicity, relative humidity). A full list of
      fields that can be generated by *unipost* is provided in
      https://dtcenter.org/sites/default/files/community-code/upp-grib2-table_0.pdf.

   -  Outputs the results in NWS and WMO standard GRIB2 format (for GRIB
      documentation, see http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/).

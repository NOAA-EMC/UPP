Introduction

The Unified Post Processor (UPP) is a software package designed to generate useful
products from raw model output.

The UPP is currently used in operations with the Global Forecast System (:term:`GFS`), GFS Ensemble Forecast
System (GEFS), North American Mesoscale (:term:`NAM`), Rapid Refresh (:term:`RAP`), High Resolution Rapid Refresh
(HRRR), Short Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF), and Hurricane WRF (HWRF) applications. It is also used
in the Unified Forecast System (:term:`UFS`), including the Rapid Refresh Forecast System (:term:`RRFS`), Hurricane
Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), and the Medium-Range Weather (:term:`MRW`) and Short-Range Weather (:term:`SRW`)
Applications.

This software package can be run inline---built as a library to be used by the model---and offline---built 
stand-alone and run separately from the model. This documentation largely details the offline
procedures.

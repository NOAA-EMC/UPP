The Unified Post Processor (UPP) is a software package designed to generate useful
products from raw model output.

The UPP is currently used in operations with the Global Forecast System (GFS), GFS Ensemble Forecast
System (GEFS), North American Mesoscale (NAM), Rapid Refresh (RAP), High Resolution Rapid Refresh
(HRRR), Short Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF), and Hurricane WRF (HWRF) applications. It is also used
in the Unified Forecasting System (UFS), including the Rapid Refresh Forecast System (RRFS), Hurricane
Application Forecasting System (HAFS), and the Medium Range Weather (MRW) and Short Range Weather (SRW)
Applications.

This software package can be run inline, built as a library to be used by the model, and offline,
built stand-alone and run separate from the model. This documentation largely details the offline
procedures.

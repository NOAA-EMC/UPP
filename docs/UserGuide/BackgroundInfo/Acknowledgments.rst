The adaptation of the original WRF Post Processor package and Users Guide (by Mike Baldwin of
NSSL/CIMMS and Hui-Ya Chuang of NCEP/EMC) was done by Lígia Bernardet (NOAA/ESRL/DTC) in collaboration
with Dusan Jovic (NCEP/EMC), Robert Rozumalski (COMET), Wesley Ebisuzaki (NWS/HQTR), and Louisa Nance
(NCAR/RAL/DTC). Upgrades to WRF Post Processor versions 2.2 and higher were performed by Hui-Ya Chuang,
Dusan Jovic, and Mathew Pyle (NCEP/EMC). Transitioning of the documentation from the WRF Post Processor
to the Unified Post Processor was performed by Nicole McKee (NCEP/EMC), Hui-Ya Chuang (NCEP/EMC), and
Jamie Wolff (NCAR/RAL/DTC). Implementation of the Community Unified Post Processor was performed by
Tricia Slovacek, Kate Fossell, and Tracy Hertneky (NCAR/RAL/DTC).
